## Hi, thanks for checking me out 👋

You probably know me as that dude on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBMOLuiTKRRBB_pvMg8iQPQ) that makes videos with Text-to-Speech voices once in a blue moon. Outside of that, I'm usually either dabbling with computers or focusing on my college work.

There's a lot of stuff I'm working on behind the scenes that I'm not ready to publish yet, so stay tuned for that!
